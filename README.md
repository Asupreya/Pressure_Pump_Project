# Pressure Pump Signal Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

This is my final-project at King's Mongkut Institute of Ladkrabang.
The goal of this project is to classify the electrical signal obtained from pressure pump to identify whether water leakage happen or not using Convolutional Neural Network in MATLAB software.
